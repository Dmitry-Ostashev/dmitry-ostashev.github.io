{"pageProps":{"content":{"html":"        <h1>TestCafe v1.3.1 Released</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>This release fixes an issue caused by <code>tsconfig.json</code> auto-detection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Version 1.3.0 introduced support for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"/documentation/402824/guides/intermediate-guides/typescript-and-coffeescript#customize-compiler-options\">custom TypeScript configuration files</a> where you can provide the compiler options. This feature included automatic detection of these configuration files. If the directory from which you run tests contained a <code>tsconfig.json</code> file, TestCafe would apply it by default.</p>\r\n<p>However, this behavior caused troubles for users who have already had <code>tsconfig.json</code> files with conflicting settings in their projects. TestCafe attempted to apply these configurations, which resulted in issues with test compilation.</p>\r\n<p>In v1.3.1, we have disabled <code>tsconfig.json</code> auto-detection. Now you must explicitly specify the <code>tsconfig.json</code> file location to apply the compiler settings. You can do it in one of the following ways:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><p>the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"/documentation/402639/reference/command-line-interface#--ts-config-path-path\">--ts-config-path</a> command line parameter,</p>\r\n<pre><code class=\"lang-sh\">testcafe chrome my-tests --ts-config-path /Users/s.johnson/testcafe/tsconfig.json\r\n</code></pre></li>\r\n<li><p>the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"/documentation/402650/reference/testcafe-api/runner/tsconfigpath\">runner.tsConfigPath</a> API method,</p>\r\n<pre><code class=\"lang-js\">runner.tsConfigPath(&#39;/Users/s.johnson/testcafe/tsconfig.json&#39;);\r\n</code></pre></li>\r\n<li><p>the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"/documentation/402638/reference/configuration-file#tsconfigpath\">tsConfigPath</a> configuration file property.</p>\r\n<pre><code class=\"lang-json\">{\r\n    &quot;tsConfigPath&quot;: &quot;/Users/s.johnson/testcafe/tsconfig.json&quot;\r\n}\r\n</code></pre></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>We strongly recommend that you upgrade to v1.3.1.
